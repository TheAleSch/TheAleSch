# Hi there 👋  
I'm a passionate interface and experience designer — and also a coder — driven by curiosity and a desire to push beyond the obvious.
Just like an architect needs to understand concrete, should understand code.

🔭 Currently focused on designing and building thoughtful, impactful experiences  
🌱 Always learning, exploring, and refining my craft.
