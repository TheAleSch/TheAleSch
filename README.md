# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a passionate interface and experience designer â€” and also a coder â€” driven by curiosity and a desire to push beyond the obvious.
Just like an architect needs to understand concrete, should understand code.

ðŸ”­ Currently focused on designing and building thoughtful, impactful experiences  
ðŸŒ± Always learning, exploring, and refining my craft.
